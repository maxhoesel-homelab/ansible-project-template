# ansible-project-template

Template repository for my internal Ansible project.

To get started:

1. Create a repository from this template
2. Update the inventory. `group_vars/all` contains examples for all required variables to integrate your hosts into the homelab
   - To use provisioning, set `awx_homelab_token` in `awx.yml` to the token generated by the create-host script
   - To use backups, adjust the parameters in `backup.yml`.
   - Change the parameters in `provisioning.yml` if you need a different hardware configuration
3. Update your dependencies in `requirements.yml` and `requirements.txt`, if required
4. Start writing playbooks! The entry point playbook is named `configure.yml`.

To run a playbook locally:

1. Install `ansible-runner`
2. Build your EE container by running `tox`
   - Temporary Hack: Install the ansible collection requirements on your local host with `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --force`. The EE container does contain the required collections, but I'm not sure how to tell ansible-runner to use them.
3. Create a folder `env` for ansible-runner - this is where you can provide optional parameters to ansible-runner and your playbook:
   - Create a file called `cmdline` with the following contents: `--ask-vault-pass`
   - Create a file called `passwords` with the following contents:
     ```yaml
     ---
     "^Vault password:\\s*?$": "your-projects-vault-password"
     ```
   - This step is required for ansible-runner to pick up and supply your vault password. Note that the `env` folder is always ignored in the gitinore to prevent accidental secret leaks.
3. Run the following command: `ansible-runner run --container-image quay.io/maxhoesel_homelab/ansible-project-<yourproject> -p configure.yml ./`
